# React + TypeScript + Vite Project for Design for Displacement


## About the project website.
This site is currently being developed to become a hub for the 5th year Dundee University Architecture course Design For Displacement.
<br>
This year focuses on the city of Marrakesh, Morocco, after the effects of the 2023 earthquake.
<br>
The site will be used to advertise the course, provide information on the city and the course,
and provide a platform for students to submit their work and for the public to view it.
